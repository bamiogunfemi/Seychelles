    What does digital penetration mean?? When you insert your finger into the pussy or booty hole
    What other activities are you proposing to partake in?

    Few days after confirmation that things went well, cause if its immediate the other party could be forced to consent that it went well.

    I see this app even becoming a fun way to flirt between partners (married people included).
Imagine receiving a consent proposal from your partner while you are at work and you are just breezing through imagining how the day will end for you.

                I also just understood that all the consent questions go both ways. So even as a proposer, you have to decide what you are also giving consent to.
  The proposer/consenter tag is just to indicate who started the request.

                Should the consent pages be questions posed to the user or statements agreed to?
                So either in the form
                This agreement is for when?
  Or
  This agreement is for.
